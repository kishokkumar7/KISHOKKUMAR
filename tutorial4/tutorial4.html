<br>
<hr size=5 color=green>
<br>
<p>A shepherd boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields<br>
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.</p>
<br>
<p>One day while grazing the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying<br>
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but <br>
didn't find any wolf.</p>
<br>
<p>The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". The boy<br>
Played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</p>
<br>
<p>After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,<br>
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.<br>
The boy was frightened and cried loudly,"Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</p>
<br>
<p>The farmers thought the boy was playing mischief again. So, no one paid<br>
attention to him and didn't come to his help.</p>

<p>Moral:No one believes a liar even if they speak the truth once.</p>
