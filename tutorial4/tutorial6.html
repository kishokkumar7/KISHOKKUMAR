<p ><font color=coral size=5><u>“	Leader of the Scarlet Sect, in the Scarlet Shadow upon the Cadia Riverlands.	”
    As the owner of Higanbana, one of the seven great armaments of the Scarlet Shadow clan,
     Hanabi is the pride of the Scarlet Sect. To carry on her father's will, 
     she has sought power since childhood. As a result of her single-minded goal, 
     she closed herself off to all feelings and emotions. Even so, she was never truly accepted by Higanbana.
      Once, when she was pursuing an enemy spy and losing ground, she accidentally stepped into the world inside 
      Higanbana and lingered between illusion and reality. Eventually, she came to understand that power without 
      emotion was volatile and fleeting. She came to terms with herself and embraced her feelings and desires as 
      she became one with Higanbana.</u></font></p>
